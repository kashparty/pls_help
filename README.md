# Propositional Logic Simplification Helper: pls_help

Haskell code to do things in propositional logic. Basically just an experiment 
for me.

Currently supports:
- [x] Expression parsing
- [x] Expression evaluation
- [ ] Expression simplification
- [x] Truth table generation
- [x] Satisfiability/validity checking
