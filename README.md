# Propositional Logic Simplification Helper: pls_help

Haskell code to do things in propositional logic. Basically just an experiment 
for me. This mostly exists just because I thought of a funny name for it. 

Currently supports:
- [x] Expression parsing
- [x] Expression evaluation
- [ ] Expression simplification
- [ ] Truth table generation
- [ ] Satisfiability/validity checking
